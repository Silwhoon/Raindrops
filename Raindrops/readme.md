# Tech Test
## Raindrops
A project that takes an integer as its input and converts it to a string containing various sounds of a raindrop based on its factors.

## Description
This project will take any integer input and return a string based on its value. 
- If the input has a factor of 3, the returned string will have 'Pling' appended to it.
- If the input has a factor of 5, the returned string will have 'Plang' appended to it.
- If the input has a factor of 7, the returned string will have 'Plong' appended to it.
- If the input does not have a factor of 3, 5 or 7 the number will be returned as a string.

## Examples
- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28: this would return a simple 'Plong'
- 30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30: this would return a 'PlingPlang'
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34: this would return '34'
